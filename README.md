Follow these steps to set up the project locally and run it on your device or emulator.

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** (2022.3.1 or later) with Android SDK tools installed.  
- **Java Development Kit**: Java 11 or higher.  
- **Gradle**: Uses the wrapper bundled in the repository (`./gradlew`).  
- **Emulator/Device**: Any Android device running Lollipop (API 21) or higher.  

> **Optional:**  
> - **Firebase Project**: If you want to test push notifications, set up a Firebase project and add the `google-services.json` file to `app/`.  
> - **REST Back-End**: The app expects a running RESTful API (e.g., at `https://api.example.com/`) for parts data, authentication, and order processing. See [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) below for details.
